Standard solutions or already existing scripts are not sufficient for the Goobi project, so a new solution has to be found. Among other things, the software that has to be developed must fulfil the following requirements: With the help of the tool it will be easier to collect and edit the different information of the journals. This affects the generation of the general metadata and the hierarchical structural data of the volumes and also concerns the matching of logical (printed) and physical page numbers. Metadata from different sources (for example from the \"\"Zentralblatt\"\" and the \"\"Jahrbuch \u00FCber die Fortschritte der Mathematik\"\") are to be imported on the basis of an XML format. Via a WebDAV server, the tool will enable read/write access on external file systems and their data (for example for quality control or editing of scanned images). Furthermore the components for distributed workflow management will be integrated into the tool. This makes it possible to manage production and communication between the project partners. Each partner can view detailed information about the status of a certain journal at any time. To allow for decentralised working, the tool will be available as a web application and may thus be accessed from distributed locations. Through the consistent adoption of Java technology, which does not depend on a special hardware or software environment, it will be ensured furthermore that both Western European and Eastern European fonts can be used within the tool by means of unicode encoding.

allgemeinesText = Goobi controls the organisation of the digitisation workflow. The software package for this cooperative and collaborative work environment is the central module, which fulfils the following functions: platform independence (web application), because the tool has to be available for use by partners world wide; central administration of the metadata, i. e. indexing and completion of the metadata from different locations (for example: generating the Russian metadata in Moscow, transliterations in Hanover); central administration of the digitised data (images); import and export interfaces for metadata and for external digitised data (for example from Russia); control mechanisms to determine which partner is at which stage of his work, which journal is at which stage of processing, etc.; problem reports, completion of a particular task and forwarding to the next stage work level (possible change of/delivery to a partner). The components of this distributed workflow management system have been integrated to ensure the efficient administration of distributed production and communication between the different partners. It can be adjusted for every single project task whether it is done in parallel to the previous one or after its successful completion. Furthermore, correction loops are mapped for later annotation of data from previous steps assessed as defective. The application has been designed for maximum transparency, so it is possible at any time for each project partner to examine the progress of the substeps including the allocation of persons for each single task detailed.
