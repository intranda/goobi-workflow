# Goobi workflow Webapp

## Build

Required: `npm` >= v5.7.1

1. Install dependencies:
  `npm i`
2. For *development* purposes: by default, the development script moves the compiled assets to the same location as the production script. If you wish to move files to another location depending on your Goobi setup, refer to the development section below.
3. Depending on your build target, run one of the following scripts:
   - `npm run dev` for *development*, move compiled assets to Tomcat and watch for further changes.
   - `npm run build` for *production*, minify assets as needed without moving them to the server. Do this before merging a PR.

## Development

A number of legacy assets can be found in `uii/template/`. Please avoid changes to these, but refer to the following sections.

### Tomcat Location

Gulp expects the location of your Tomcat in a global configuration file. This file should be found at `~/.config/gulp_userconfig.json`. The location should be provided similar to this pattern:

```JSON
{
    "tomcatLocation": "/PATH/TO/TOMCAT/webapps/workflow-core/"
}
```

### Javascript

New JS modules should be included in `uii/templatePG/js/modules/`. Import new modules in `uii/templatesPG/js/main.js` so that Rollup can handle them.

### CSS

#### Bootstrap

Goobi workflow styles are based on [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/), using select imports. The main SASS file fo these imports is `uii/templatePG/css/src/bootstrap.scss`. Bootstrap variables declared in `uii/templatePG/css/src/_overrides.scss`.

#### Custom Styles

Bootstrap 5 is extended with custom styles.
Custom styles are organized in sass files which are imported into `uii/templatePG/css/src/main.scss`.

They are divided into three categories:

1. `Base` includes basic styles like colors, typography and utilities etc.
2. `Components` includes styles for reusable components, e.g. navbar, boxes, forms, buttons.
3. `Pages` includes styles unique to certain views. Views are scoped using a class, e.g.:

```xhtml
<main class="batch-all">...</main>
```

## Accessibility: High Contrast mode

Goobi workflow has a high contrast mode, which is called `WCAG compliant mode`. `WCAG compliant mode` can be set in the `user configuration`. `templagePG.xhtml` will then load additional styles overriding css color properties. The corresponding scss module is `uii/templatePG/css/src/accessibility.scss`.
